# üìù Student Attendance Management System

## Overview
The Student Attendance Management System is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows students and teachers to manage attendance records efficiently. The application provides functionalities for student login, teacher login, account creation, and generating student identity cards.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Separate login interfaces for students and teachers.
- **Account Creation**: Allows new students to create accounts with necessary details.
- **Identity Card Generation**: Generates a student identity card with personal details.
- **Attendance Policy Information**: Provides information about attendance policies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for easy navigation.

## Limitations
1. Simulation: This application is a simulation and is not intended for real-world use.

2. Student Data Requirement: Before accessing the system, a text file containing student attendance data must be created. This file is necessary for both teachers and students to access their information.

3. Limited User Accounts: The application has been coded to support only the first three students with roll numbers 1, 2, and 3. Their corresponding passwords are "one", "two", and "three", respectively.

4. Dummy ID Generation: The ID generation feature is not functional for actual ID creation. It is designed to demonstrate how to capture a student's image for ID generation and save that image to the user's machine.

5. Teacher Credentials: The teacher's username is "Admin" and the password is "786".
